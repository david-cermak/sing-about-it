# Learning Sheet Generator Enhancement Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Transform the current snippet-based system into a comprehensive web content scraping and analysis system that provides full-text content to the LLM for generating high-quality learning sheets.

## 🏗️ Current Architecture Issues
- **Limited Information**: Only using search snippets (~100 characters each)
- **Poor Content Quality**: LLM lacks detailed information to create comprehensive learning sheets
- **No Source Validation**: All sources treated equally regardless of relevance or quality
- **Single-file Complexity**: All functionality cramped into one file

## 🚀 Proposed Enhanced Architecture

### 🔄 Enhanced Workflow

#### Phase 1: Search & Discovery
1. **Multi-Query Search**: Execute 5 different search queries (as current)
2. **Result Aggregation**: Collect all search results with URLs
3. **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate URLs across different searches

#### Phase 2: Intelligent Source Selection
4. **Source Evaluation Agent**:
   - Analyze search results (title, snippet, URL)
   - Score sources based on:
     - Relevance to topic
     - Authority/credibility of domain
     - Content type (educational, commercial, blog, etc.)
     - Recency (for time-sensitive topics)
   - Select top N sources for scraping (configurable, default: 8-10)

#### Phase 3: Content Acquisition
5. **Web Scraping**:
   - Scrape full text content from selected sources
   - Handle different content types (articles, PDFs, etc.)
   - Implement rate limiting and respectful scraping
   - Error handling for failed scrapes
6. **Content Processing**:
   - Clean HTML, remove navigation/ads
   - Extract main article content
   - Chunk content if too large for LLM context
   - Preserve source attribution

#### Phase 4: Learning Sheet Generation
7. **Enhanced LLM Prompt**:
   - Include full scraped content instead of snippets
   - Provide source metadata and credibility scores
   - Request citations and references in output
8. **Quality Learning Sheet**: Generate comprehensive, well-sourced content

    relevance_score: float = Field(description="Relevance to topic (0-1)")
    authority_score: float = Field(description="Domain authority (0-1)")
    content_type: str = Field(description="Type: academic, news, blog, commercial")
    should_scrape: bool = Field(description="Whether to scrape this source")
    reasoning: str = Field(description="Why this source was selected/rejected")
```

### Enhanced Learning Sheet Model
```python
class EnhancedLearningSheet(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(description="Title of the learning sheet")
    content: str = Field(description="~2000 word comprehensive report in Markdown")
    key_takeaways: List[str] = Field(description="5-7 bullet point takeaways")
    sources_used: List[str] = Field(description="URLs of sources actually referenced")
    confidence_score: float = Field(description="Confidence in information accuracy")
```
